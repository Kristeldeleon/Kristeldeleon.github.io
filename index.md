## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

* Lab 1
  
  This was one of my favorite labs because it was the first time I ever got to compile and run a program. I was able to get more familiar with using the terminal and Visual Studio Code. This lab gave me a sense of accomplishment, and I gained more confidence as well as unlocking a new world of possibilities.

* Lab 7, part 1

  This was one of my favorite labs because I got to implement booleans, which opened up a new level of logic and control. It was interesting to see how booleans allowed me to create statements, making my programs more dynamic and responsive. Through this experience, I gained a deeper understanding of how to design codes to achieve specific outcomes.

* Lab 12, part 2
  
  This lab was my favorite because I enjoyed the creative aspects involved. I learned how to generate an animated gif from individual images, which was an exciting skill to develop. It was great to see the image come to life and experiment with the text, adding another layer of creativity.
